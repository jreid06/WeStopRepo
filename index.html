Become Too Much? 
</h4> </div>
                <div class="modal-body"> When you first got your mortgage, you could handle your payments. But life has a way of turning upside down. If you've had a divorce or lost your job, you may suddenly be in a position where you can only pay a portion of the mortgage.
                    <br>
                    <br>Unfortunately, the bank doesn't allow partial payments. They want it all, and they want it now, despite any health problems or other circumstances that are beyond your control. When you've tried your hardest, and find yourself out of time to make up the mortgage payments, what you need is our experience.
                    <br>

Even so, you want to get a fair price for it.
