                                <p class="answer">Estate agents “list” properties. They charge you a commission to sell your property. There are no guarantees, if, when and how much your property will sell for. The average property takes months to sell. Some take over a year! This uncertainty causes great stress and anxiety.<br><br> On top of that, you have to constantly keep your home spotless "just in case" a possible buyer wants to look at your property. Usually not until the day your property sells and you get your money, do you even know exactly how much you’re going to receive.</p>
                            <p class="answer">As your local, independent, professional property investor, we do not want to “list” your property, we want to buy your property... NOW!<br><br>We do not charge you any fees or commissions. Often within 24 to 48 hours we can make you a fast cash offer, and often as quickly as seven days or sooner you can have your money!
We want you to have <strong>a fast</strong>, hassle-free, stress-free <strong>sale!</strong>

                               <p class="answer">Please do not confuse what a estate agent tells you is the value of your property, with how much money you will actually put in your pocket if, and when the property sells.
First of all, it is quite common for a home or property to sell for 10 to 20 percent less than what the estate agent lists it for.<br><br>
Secondly, when using real estate agents, it not uncommon that you as the seller, will probably be required to do a number of repairs to satisfy the buyer. These repairs could cost thousands of pounds.<br><br>
Third, do not forget your holding costs. (Mortgage, Electric, Gas, Council Tax payments and the cost of your money tied up in the property, which could be making you money, somewhere else.) A estate agent will not make your mortgage payments for you while you wait for a buyer. We will buy your house now!<br><br>
Finally there are commissions to the agent which can be as high as 7 percent, and your completion costs which can be as much as 3 percent.
</p>
                                <p class="answer"><strong>Bottom Line:</strong><br><br>
A estate agent could tell you your house or property is worth X amount of pounds. By the time your agent sells it, figure in your holding costs, repair costs, commissions, selling costs etc. etc., you might put X amount of money, less tens of thousands in your pocket!
